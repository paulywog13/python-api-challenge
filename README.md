# python-api-challenge

The goal of this challenge was to use the python and pandas coding along with Weather and Google Map APIs in order to analyse the weather of a variety of cities chosen at random. After gathering the weather data of the cities, we needed to analyze the weather data of the cities and use the data to create a variety of Scatter Plots and Linear Regression lines to identify if there is any correlation to the weather based upon the location of the city. Finally we used the weather data to create a list of cities based upon our ideal weather conditions and to plot the cities onto a world map along with markers and the hotel nearest the city.

Data used in this challenge: Google API Key, WeatherMaps API Key

Dependancies used: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, requests, time, scipy.stats, json, and citypy

My analysis of the scatterplot graphs is located beneath each generated graph in a Markdown cell. 

My main takeaway from this project is that there is a ton of data available that we can use powerful and useful tools like pandas, matplotlib, and numpy we can use in order to organize, analyse, and summarize data. I also think citypy is a fantastic tool to use to find geographical data from across the world.

The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was in the finding the first hotel listed for each of my cities and saving it in a new dataFrame as it took a few tries to get my code to be correct and find the right type of lodging. 

Overall I found this homework challenge defintely pushed my coding knowledge, helped me to understand for loops a littel better, and gave me a great oportunty to learn how to utilizy try/except/else errors and restrictions. I truly enjoyed this challenge.
